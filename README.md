
# Focus or Death


### Project Description

A cutting-edge, AI-powered *productivity assassin* that uses facial detection and emotion recognition to decide if you deserve to keep using your computer.
Look away, smile too much, or just look a bit sad — *poof*, shutdown.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Some people keep working even when they shouldn’t. Others slack off when they *should* be working. And nobody is policing their **eye contact** with the screen.
This is clearly the single greatest problem of our time. Obviously.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

A webcam-based *face dictator* that monitors your mood and gaze, and if it decides you’re unworthy — it shuts your PC down instantly.
No warnings. No mercy. No Ctrl+Z.
